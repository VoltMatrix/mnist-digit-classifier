MNIST Digit Classifier with Scikit-Learn
Welcome to Digit Classifier 101! This beginner-to-intermediate machine learning project shows how to build, evaluate, and improve classifiers that recognize handwritten digits using the legendary MNIST dataset

What’s MNIST?
MNIST is a dataset of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Each image is 28x28 pixels, and the task is to correctly recognize the digit shown.

Project Goals
Learn how to load and visualize image data

Build models to detect the digit “5” (binary classification)
Evaluate precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve
Train a multi-class classifier for all digits (0–9)
Compare models: SGDClassifier, RandomForest, SVC
Use techniques like StandardScaler, OneVsRestClassifier, and ConfusionMatrix for performance boosting
